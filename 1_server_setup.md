# Server Setup

In this assignment, you will create the server and routes for the following resources:

* Topics: Create, Read
* Posts: Create, Read, Read Posts by Topic ID
* Users: Create User (with proper registration security).

For your convenience, we have provided migrations, seeds, and validations for use in your code.

**NOTE** Do not worry about authentication yet. It will be included later in the project. Use user id `1` for creating posts when assigning it to a user in the meantime.

## Bonus

Add tests for your routes using Mocha, Chai, and supertest.
