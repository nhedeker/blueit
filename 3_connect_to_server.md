# Connect to Server

In this assignment, you will connect the client application you have been working on to the server application you have created.

## Requirements

* Remove any hard coded data into your application that you will obtain from the server (topics, posts, users).
* Use the `$http` service to make connections to your server for posts, topics, and user registration (not authentication). Feel free to place these calls in the controllers. You will extract these calls out into custom services in the next assignment.
* Add client side routing for at least one new page.
